In the past, I've had the opportunity to work on a variety of exciting research projects!

<h3>University of Illinois </h3>
I've been working with the [Molecule Maker Lab Institute](https://moleculemaker.org/) on integrating molecule and text information. We're working on integrating new methodologies with real-world laboratory experimentation for drug and material discovery (stay tuned)! Past work includes proposing multiple novel tasks such as cross-modal retrieval: [Text2Mol (EMNLP2021)](https://aclanthology.org/2021.emnlp-main.47/)

and cross-modal generation: [Translation between Molecules and Natural Language (EMNLP 2022)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.11817).

<h3>Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence (AI2) - Semantic Scholar Team </h3>

I had a great time working on drug synergy with LLMs during summer 2022 at the Semantic Scholar team. The project evolved from semi-parameteric language models using the literature to in-context learning and drug design. See our preprint [here](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.07.06.547759v1).

<h3>Carnegie Mellon University </h3>

During summer 2019, I worked at CMU as a Robotics Institute Summer Scholar. I conducted research in the Auton Lab with Prof. Artur Dubrawski working on detecting organizations in online escort advertisements. I used several similarity measures using tools like fastText word embeddings, face recognition, and others.

<h3>University of Zurich </h3>
During Fall 2018, I studied abroad at the University of Zurich in Zurich, Switzerland. While I was there, I worked on creating joint embeddings between images and knowledge graphs. My project report is [here](https://cnedwards.com/files/studyabroad_report.pdf).

<h3>Oak Ridge National Lab </h3>
I interned at ORNL during the summers of 2017 and 2018 through the HERE and DOE SULI programs respectively. I worked on optimizing phase values in continuous subarrayed radar arrays using metaheuristic techniques like genetic algorithms and simulated annealing.

<h3>University of Tennessee </h3>
From fall 2016 to spring 2018, I worked as an undergraduate research assistant. I worked on molecular dynamics simulations and data analysis. I also performed Brownian dynamics simulations of flowing polymer solutions, and I extracted solution properties from the resulting data.
