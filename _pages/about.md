Hi! My name is Carl Edwards and I'm from Knoxville, Tennessee. I'm a senior in computer science at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville. Additionally, I'm double majoring in math. In the future, I'd like to pursue research in machine learning and AI. I believe that a critical next step in the development of machine learning will be the creation of models that can generalize well on multiple tasks and which learn from multiple contrasting yet complementary domains of data. This is why I've developed an interest in the areas of machine learning that incorporate multiple modalities of data, such as multiview learning or joint embeddings for different data types (like text or knowledge graphs). Additionally, I am interested in multi-task and transfer learning as well as reinforcement learning and NLP. During my undergraduate career, I've had the opportunity to work on some exciting research projects!



Resume

See my resume attached [here](https://cnedwards.github.io/files/Edwards_resume.pdf)

Research
======
<h3>University of Tennessee </h3>
From fall 2016 to spring 2018, I worked as an undergraduate research assistant. I worked on molecular dynamics simulations and data analysis. I also performed Brownian dynamics simulations of flowing polymer solutions, and I extracted solution properties from the resulting data.

<h3>Oak Ridge National Lab </h3>
I interned at ORNL during the summers of 2017 and 2018 through the HERE and DOE SULI programs respectively. I worked on optimizing phase values in continuous subarrayed radar arrays using metaheuristic techniques like genetic algorithms and simulated annealing.

<h3>University of Zurich </h3>
During Fall 2018, I studied abroad at the University of Zurich in Zurich, Switzerland. While I was there, I worked on creating joint embeddings between images and knowledge graphs. My project report is [here](https://cnedwards.github.io/files/studyabroad_report.pdf).

<h3>Carnegie Mellon University </h3>

During summer 2019, I worked at CMU as a Robotics Institute Summer Scholar. I conducted research in the Auton Lab with Dr. Dubrawski working on detecting organization in online escort advertisements. I used several similarity measures using things like fastText word embeddings, face recognition, and others.
