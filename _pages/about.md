Hi! My name is Carl Edwards, and I'm from Knoxville, Tennessee. I'm a PhD student in computer science at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign where I'm advised by [Professor Heng Ji](http://blender.cs.illinois.edu/hengji.html). I completed my bachelor's degree at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville in May 2020 where I majored in CS and math. Generally, I'm interested <!---I believe that a critical next step in the development of AI will be the creation of --> in models that can generalize well on multiple tasks and which learn from multiple contrasting yet complementary domains of data. Specifically, I'm interested in leveraging multiple modalities and domains of data centered around language. My research interests cover information extraction, information retrieval, natural language processing, representation learning, text mining, transfer learning, and multi-task learning. I'm currently working on projects related to chemistry literature, which provides an exciting testbed for these areas. 

In the past, I've had the opportunity to work on a variety of exciting research projects!

Research
======

<h3>University of Illinois </h3>
I've been working with the [Molecule Maker Lab Institute](https://moleculemaker.org/). More details will come soon.

<h3>Carnegie Mellon University </h3>

During summer 2019, I worked at CMU as a Robotics Institute Summer Scholar. I conducted research in the Auton Lab with Dr. Dubrawski working on detecting organization in online escort advertisements. I used several similarity measures using tools like fastText word embeddings, face recognition, and others.

<h3>University of Zurich </h3>
During Fall 2018, I studied abroad at the University of Zurich in Zurich, Switzerland. While I was there, I worked on creating joint embeddings between images and knowledge graphs. My project report is [here](https://cnedwards.com/files/studyabroad_report.pdf).

<h3>Oak Ridge National Lab </h3>
I interned at ORNL during the summers of 2017 and 2018 through the HERE and DOE SULI programs respectively. I worked on optimizing phase values in continuous subarrayed radar arrays using metaheuristic techniques like genetic algorithms and simulated annealing.

<h3>University of Tennessee </h3>
From fall 2016 to spring 2018, I worked as an undergraduate research assistant. I worked on molecular dynamics simulations and data analysis. I also performed Brownian dynamics simulations of flowing polymer solutions, and I extracted solution properties from the resulting data.
