Hi! My name is Carl Edwards, and I'm from Knoxville, Tennessee. I'm a PhD student in computer science at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign where I'm advised by [Professor Heng Ji](http://blender.cs.illinois.edu/hengji.html). I completed my bachelor's degree at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville in May 2020 where I majored in CS and math. Generally, I'm interested in models which leverage multiple modalities and domains of data centered around language. My research interests cover information extraction, information retrieval, natural language processing, representation learning, text mining, and transfer learning. My work seeks to apply these interests to scientific texts to accelerate scientific discovery. I’m currently working on projects related to chemistry literature, particularly related to drug discovery and improvement, in association with the Molecule Maker Lab NSF AI Institute.

News
=====

* I've released a preprint on "[Translation between Molecules and Natural Language](https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.11817)". It includes multiple elements I've been thinking about for a while, so I'm very excited about it. Thanks to my collaborators for making it possible!

Research
======

In the past, I've had the opportunity to work on a variety of exciting research projects!

<h3>University of Illinois </h3>
I've been working with the [Molecule Maker Lab Institute](https://moleculemaker.org/) on integrating molecule and text information. This includes work on cross-modal retrieval: [Text2Mol (EMNLP2021)](https://aclanthology.org/2021.emnlp-main.47/)

and cross-modal generation: [Translation between Molecules and Natural Language (EMNLP 2022)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.11817).

<h3>Carnegie Mellon University </h3>

During summer 2019, I worked at CMU as a Robotics Institute Summer Scholar. I conducted research in the Auton Lab with Prof. Artur Dubrawski working on detecting organizations in online escort advertisements. I used several similarity measures using tools like fastText word embeddings, face recognition, and others.

<h3>University of Zurich </h3>
During Fall 2018, I studied abroad at the University of Zurich in Zurich, Switzerland. While I was there, I worked on creating joint embeddings between images and knowledge graphs. My project report is [here](https://cnedwards.com/files/studyabroad_report.pdf).

<h3>Oak Ridge National Lab </h3>
I interned at ORNL during the summers of 2017 and 2018 through the HERE and DOE SULI programs respectively. I worked on optimizing phase values in continuous subarrayed radar arrays using metaheuristic techniques like genetic algorithms and simulated annealing. 

<img src="https://cnedwards.com/images/array_phase_values.png?raw=true" alt="Optimized radar array. Note the cyclic behavior of the phase values." style="width: 450px;"/> 


<h3>University of Tennessee </h3>
From fall 2016 to spring 2018, I worked as an undergraduate research assistant. I worked on molecular dynamics simulations and data analysis. I also performed Brownian dynamics simulations of flowing polymer solutions, and I extracted solution properties from the resulting data.
