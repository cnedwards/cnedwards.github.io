Hi! My name is Carl Edwards, and I'm from Knoxville, Tennessee. I'm a PhD candidate in computer science at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign where I'm advised by [Professor Heng Ji](http://blender.cs.illinois.edu/hengji.html). My research focuses on, with increasing specificity, AI4Science &rarr; NLP4Science &rarr; NLP4Chemistry &rarr; NLP for Controlling Molecular Design in cancer drugs, organic photovoltaics, etc. 

The world faces an enormous number of problems in the coming decades on scales of complexity never-before-seen, in areas such as climate change, healthcare, and pandemics. To address these issues, we need to discover inventive solutions which are scalable, flexible, and inexpensive. Further, we need to develop these solutions quickly. Under these conditions, vast quantities of information are being created at ever increasing rates. This flood of information leads to inefficiencies via duplication of effort while critical information is lost in the deluge of papers. To solve these problems, we need to be able to synthesize and understand massive scales of information. This motivates my high-level research direction: applying natural language processing (NLP) for scientific discovery. Specifically, I am currently interested in NLP for molecular and drug discovery, particularly by integrating natural language with molecules.

In terms of research interests, I am generally interested in models which leverage multiple modalities and domains of data centered around language. My research interests cover information extraction, information retrieval, natural language processing, representation learning, text mining, and transfer learning. In particular, my work seeks to apply these tools (and develop new ones!) to scientific texts to accelerate scientific discovery. I’m currently working on projects related to chemistry literature in association with the Molecule Maker Lab NSF AI Institute. In general, I'm passionate about language+multimodal for compositional function-level control of drugs, proteins, and material design.


News
=====
* I'll be organizing the first ["Language + Molecules" workshop at ACL24](https://language-plus-molecules.github.io/) in Bangkok and presenting an introductory tutorial earlier at EACL24 in Malta! I'm very excited to contribute to building a community in this impactful new research area. 

* Had the chance to contribute to two papers accepted to EMNLP findings! Thanks to my colleagues and collaborators!

* I gave a talk on "[Language-Guided Scientific Discovery for Chemistry](https://twitter.com/CTC_Germany/status/1699412907652465054)" at the exciting new [Center for the Transformation of Chemistry](https://transforming-chemistry.org/)! [Here](https://cnedwards.com/files/CTC_talk_website.pdf) are the slides from my talk! In particular, I'm partial to [this key overview slide](https://cnedwards.com/files/CTC_key_slide.pdf). 

* I'm excited to have contributed to the exciting "[Artificial Intelligence for Science in Quantum, Atomistic, and Continuum Systems
](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.08423)" survey! Particularly, my contribution focused on the " Natural Language-Guided Scientific Discovery" section.

* I've released a new preprint: "[SynerGPT: In-Context Learning for Personalized Drug Synergy Prediction and Drug Design](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.07.06.547759v1)". Thanks to my collaborators at AI2 and UIUC for making it possible!

Research
======

In the past, I've had the opportunity to work on a variety of exciting research projects!

<h3>University of Illinois </h3>
I've been working with the [Molecule Maker Lab Institute](https://moleculemaker.org/) on integrating molecule and text information. We're working on integrating new methodologies with real-world laboratory experimentation for drug and material discovery (stay tuned)! Past work includes proposing multiple novel tasks such as cross-modal retrieval: [Text2Mol (EMNLP2021)](https://aclanthology.org/2021.emnlp-main.47/) 

<img src="https://cnedwards.com/images/text2mol_task.PNG?raw=true" alt="Text2Mol Task" style="width: 500px;"/> 

and cross-modal generation: [Translation between Molecules and Natural Language (EMNLP 2022)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.11817).

<h3>Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence (AI2) - Semantic Scholar Team </h3>

I had a great time working on drug synergy with LLMs during summer 2022 at the Semantic Scholar team. The project evolved from semi-parameteric language models using the literature to in-context learning and drug design. See our preprint [here](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.07.06.547759v1).

<h3>Carnegie Mellon University </h3>

During summer 2019, I worked at CMU as a Robotics Institute Summer Scholar. I conducted research in the Auton Lab with Prof. Artur Dubrawski working on detecting organizations in online escort advertisements. I used several similarity measures using tools like fastText word embeddings, face recognition, and others.

<h3>University of Zurich </h3>
During Fall 2018, I studied abroad at the University of Zurich in Zurich, Switzerland. While I was there, I worked on creating joint embeddings between images and knowledge graphs. My project report is [here](https://cnedwards.com/files/studyabroad_report.pdf).

<h3>Oak Ridge National Lab </h3>
I interned at ORNL during the summers of 2017 and 2018 through the HERE and DOE SULI programs respectively. I worked on optimizing phase values in continuous subarrayed radar arrays using metaheuristic techniques like genetic algorithms and simulated annealing. 

<img src="https://cnedwards.com/images/array_phase_values.png?raw=true" alt="Optimized radar array. Note the cyclic behavior of the phase values." style="width: 450px;"/> 


<h3>University of Tennessee </h3>
From fall 2016 to spring 2018, I worked as an undergraduate research assistant. I worked on molecular dynamics simulations and data analysis. I also performed Brownian dynamics simulations of flowing polymer solutions, and I extracted solution properties from the resulting data.
